# Find Your Hat  
Find Your Hat is a Node.js interactive terminal game written in JavaScript.  
It requires Node.js and the NPM prompt-sync package to be installed.  
The NPM prompt-sync package creates the automatic terminal prompts for player input.  
   
The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes,  
and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.  
There are some gameplay options when you start. The sinkhole mode makes it fun.  
This is my adapted and expanded version of a Codecademy project.
